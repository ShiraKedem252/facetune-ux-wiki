description: Ingest raw sources into the wiki. Use when the user adds new files to raw/ and says "ingest", "process this", "add to wiki", or drops a new research report, competitive analysis, article, or any document. Reads raw sources, creates wiki pages, updates existing pages, maintains index and log.

# Wiki Ingest

Process raw source documents into the wiki. This is the core operation — transforming raw sources into structured, interlinked wiki knowledge.

**Working directory:** The wiki project root (contains `raw/`, `wiki/`, `CLAUDE.md`).

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` — Optional path(s) to specific raw files to ingest. If omitted, detect new/unprocessed files in `raw/`.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Sources

If specific files are given in `$ARGUMENTS`, use those. Otherwise:
- Read `wiki/log.md` to see what's already been ingested
- Scan `raw/` for files not yet referenced in any wiki page's `sources:` frontmatter
- Present the list to the user and confirm which to ingest

### 2. Read Sources

Read each raw source document in full. Handle different file types:

- **Markdown / text files** — read directly with the Read tool.
- **PPTX (presentation decks)** — use python-pptx to extract slide text. Shira's headlines ARE the findings — treat them as the primary insights. Extract speaker notes too.
- **PDF files** — use the pdf skill or pdfplumber to extract text and tables.
- **DOCX files** — use python-docx to extract text, headings, and tables.
- **CSV / XLSX** — use pandas to read and summarize the data structure, key columns, and notable patterns.

For large files, read in sections. Save the extracted text as a companion `.extracted.md` file in `raw/` alongside the original for future reference.

### 3. Discuss Key Takeaways

Before writing wiki pages, briefly summarize to the user:
- What the source covers
- Key claims, data points, or insights
- How it relates to existing wiki content (check `wiki/index.md` first)
- Any contradictions with existing wiki pages

Ask the user what to emphasize or de-emphasize.

### 4. Create/Update Wiki Pages

For each source:

**a. Create a source summary page** (if the source is substantial enough):
```markdown
---
title: Source Title
type: source
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
sources:
  - raw/filename.md
tags:
  - relevant-tags
---

# Source Title

Summary content with [[wikilinks]].

## References

- [[related-page]] - connection description
```

**b. Update existing wiki pages** that are affected by the new information:
- Read relevant wiki pages (find them via `wiki/index.md` or grep)
- Add new information, note agreements or contradictions
- Add the new raw source to the page's `sources:` list
- Update the `updated:` date

**c. Create new entity/concept pages** if the source introduces topics not yet covered:
- For research findings → type: `finding`
- For competitor info → type: `competitor`
- For user segments → type: `persona`
- For UX methods → type: `methodology`
- For product features → type: `product`

### 5. Update Index

Add new pages to the appropriate category in `wiki/index.md`:
```
- [[page-name]] - one-line summary
```

### 6. Update Log

Append to `wiki/log.md`:
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title
Summary of what was done. Pages created: [[page1]], [[page2]]. Pages updated: [[page3]].
```

## Page Format Rules

- Filenames: lowercase, hyphenated (e.g. `wiki/mobile-editing-workflow.md`)
- YAML frontmatter: title, type, created, updated, sources, tags
- Types: `source | entity | concept | comparison | analysis | overview | finding | methodology | competitor | persona | product`
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` liberally for cross-references
- One concept per page — split if over ~300 lines
- Always check for existing pages before creating new ones
- Research findings should preserve: sample size, methodology, confidence level, date of study

## Batch Mode

For many sources at once, use subagents:
- Group sources thematically (~10-15 per agent)
- Each agent creates wiki pages but does NOT touch `index.md` or `log.md`
- Consolidate index and log after all agents complete
